>The project is a part of the learning from [ Sir Hitesh Choudhary's ](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) course on FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT WEB DEVELOPER. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
